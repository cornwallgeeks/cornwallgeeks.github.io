## Getting started ##

If you're new to Jekyll, check out http://jekyllrb.com/ and read up on Jekyll. It's worth it.

* [Github's guide to using Jekyll with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)

### Installing ##

As simple as forking the repository, and then clone it so you can edit the files locally.

### Configuration ###

Edit `_config.yml`!

You can find `_config.yml` in your site's root directory. This configuration file contains some necessary settings and some optional customization settings. **All settings are explained in `_config.yml` itself.** Also make sure to use the developement configuration file (`_config_dev.yml`) for running your site locally. This way you don't get your URLs mixed up.

There are some customizations that can't be done in `_config.yml`. These include:

* Editing the About, Contact and Archive page.
* Adding or removing pages from the navigation. This can be done in `\_includes\navigation.html`.
* The "thanks" page after a message has been send through the contact page: `thanks.md`
* The gradient on cover images: `\_includes\gradient.css` (this is explained in `_config.yml`).

Also make sure to replace the placeholder favicons and the `\img\og-image.jpg` with your own.

### Start the Jekyll server ###

You can learn how to do this by reading [this](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).

> Tip: to run your site locally with `_config_dev.yml` as configuration file, use this command at the root of your site `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config_dev.yml`.

When everything is OK, your site should now be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

That's it.

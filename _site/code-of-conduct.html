	<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
		<h2 id="when-something-happens">When Something Happens</h2>

<p>If you see a Code of Conduct violation, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop and/or edit their message(s).</li>
  <li>That person should immediately stop the behavior and correct the issue.</li>
  <li>If this doesn’t happen, or if you’re uncomfortable speaking up, <a href="#contacting-admins">contact admins</a>.</li>
  <li>As soon as available, an admin will join, identify themselves, and take <a href="/enforcement">further action</a>, starting with a warning, then temporary deactivation, then long-term deactivation.</li>
</ol>

<p>When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.</p>

<p><strong>The Admin team will prioritize the well-being and comfort of the recipients of the violation over the comfort of the violator.</strong></p>

<h2 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h2>

<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as members of the Cornwall Geeks community pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, technical preferences, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>

<h2 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h2>

<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language.</li>
  <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.</li>
  <li>Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.</li>
  <li>Focusing on what is best for the community.</li>
  <li>Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances, including when simulated online. The only exception to sexual topics is channels/spaces specifically for topics of sexual identity.</li>
  <li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.</li>
  <li>Public or private harassment, deliberate intimidation, or threats.</li>
  <li>Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission. This includes any sort of “outing” of any aspect of someone’s identity without their consent.</li>
  <li>Publishing screenshots or quotes without all quoted users’ <em>explicit</em> consent.</li>
  <li>Publishing of non-harassing private communication.</li>
  <li>Any of the above even when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_racism">presented as “ironic” or “joking”</a>.</li>
  <li>Any attempt to present “reverse-ism” versions of the above as violations. Examples of reverse-isms are “reverse racism”, “reverse sexism”, “heterophobia”, and “cisphobia”.</li>
  <li>Unsolicited explanations under the assumption that someone doesn’t already know it. Ask before you teach! Don’t assume what people’s knowledge gaps are.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-feigned-surprise">Feigning or exaggerating surprise</a> when someone admits to not knowing something.</li>
  <li>“<a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-well-actuallys">Well-actuallies</a>”</li>
  <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within community spaces and in other spaces involving the community. This includes the Cornwall Geeks Slack, its Twitter community, private email communications in the context of the community, and any events where members of the community are participating, as well as adjacent communities and venues affecting the community’s members.</p>

<p>Depending on the violation, the admins may decide that violations of this code of conduct that have happened outside of the scope of the community may deem an individual unwelcome, and take appropriate action to maintain the comfort and safety of its members.</p>

<h2 id="admin-enforcement-process">Admin Enforcement Process</h2>

<p>Once the admins get involved, they will follow a documented series of steps and do their best to preserve the well-being of Cornwall Geeks members. This section covers actual concrete steps. For further information/details on values and practices that admins will generally apply when enforcing the Code of Conduct, refer to <a href="/enforcement">the full enforcement document</a>.</p>

<h3 id="contacting-admins">Contacting Admins</h3>

<p>You may get in touch with the Cornwall Geeks admin team through any of the following methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Directly message any <a href="/organisers">admin</a> in private (through either Twitter, Slack, or email, as available) if it is a preferred or more comfortable avenue.</li>
  <li>Email the admins directly at <a href="mailto:cornwallgeeks@gmail.com">cornwallgeeks@gmail.com</a>
</li>
  <li>Direct Message <a href="https://twitter.com/CornwallGeeks">@CornwallGeeks</a> on Twitter with the details and any relevant links.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="further-enforcement">Further Enforcement</h3>

<p>You can read about enforcement and the steps Admins will take on the <a href="/enforcement">Enforcement page</a>.</p>

<p>Admins may remove any offending messages, images, contributions, etc, as they deem necessary.</p>

<p>Admins reserve full rights to skip any of these steps, at their discretion, if the violation is considered to be a serious and/or immediate threat to the health and well-being of members of the community. These include any threats, serious physical or verbal attacks, and other such behavior that would be completely unacceptable in any social setting that puts our members at risk.</p>

<p>Members expelled from events or venues with any sort of paid attendance will not be refunded.</p>

<h3 id="who-watches-the-watchers">Who Watches the Watchers?</h3>

<p>Admins and other leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the community’s leadership. These may include anything from removal from the admin team to a permanent ban from the community.</p>

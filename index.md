Cornwall Geeks is an online & offline community of people that talk about geeky stuff. Programming, design, and gaming are a few examples but there are [many more](/slack).

We organise [monthly meetups](/meetup) on the [Cornwall Digital Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Cornwall-Digital/). There is also a community Slack you can join by visiting [join.cornwallgeeks.net](https://join.cornwallgeeks.net).

We aim to be an inclusive and supportive community where everyone can feel welcome. If you'd like to to know how we do this you can read our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) and [Enforcement policy](/enforcement). You can also get in touch with any of our [Admins](/organisers).
